### Our Programs
* Case Management Program – We provide an intensive case management program that we encourage you to take part in to work out what is the best course of action for you.
* Transitional Housing Program – For those who successfully address their crisis issues but still need a certain level of support and are unable to secure independent accommodation, we may be able to offer a place in the Transitional Housing Program.
* External Support Program – Our agency also offers some external support which enables a young person to access our service for support but continue on their own journey whilst still maintaining independent accommodation. This may be support, mentoring, referral to other agencies, use of telephone or internet.

THIS IS YOUR LIFE  – We will not override your decisions but assist you, as and when it is necessary to access the varying options that may be available to assist you in your situation. Our aim is to create an environment which will help empower you to take responsibility for yourself and to support you to develop skills and a lifestyle to cope and succeed in the wider community.
