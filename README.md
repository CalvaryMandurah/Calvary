### About Us

#### Calvary Vision Statement 
Young people in crisis achieve growth in confidence, opportunity and purpose for a successful future.

#### Calvary Vision Statement 
Calvary is a Christian organisation, committed to providing safe, secure and supported accommodation to young people (between the ages of 15 and 25) experiencing, or at risk of homelessness. Our approach is holistic, inclusive, strengths based and future focused, empowering individuals to maximise their full potential to achieve healthy, sustainable life choices in their journey to independence.

#### Our Core Values
##### Inclusivity
Calvary welcomes and embraces all young people respecting their individuality and diversity.

##### Collaboration
We commit to working collaboratively with other services and departments to achieve the shared goal of providing quality and supportive services to young people who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.

##### Professionalism
We operate ethically, with accountability and transparency in the provision of quality services with a commitment to continual improvement through professional development with a dedication to personal and professional growth.

##### Faith
To follow in the leadership of Jesus Christ as an example of love, mercy, compassion, forgiveness and hope in our approach to working effectively with all young people at risk. We believe that Prayer is powerful and through faith in God prayer can change circumstances.

#### Our Logo
The Calvary logo was created by an indigenous client who was residing in the crisis centre at the time. The logo symbolises the journey a young person may experience when they encounter our accommodation program.
The sun offers warmth and hope as the pathway tells of the good times and challenges facing young people seeking to break free from their crisis issue.
The logo also includes the wave which is a feature of the Peel region and also symbolises the often difficult challenges of riding the wave safely to shore.
The pathway ultimately leads towards the sun and a horizon of hope, possibility and success
