We are committed to providing safe and secure accommodation to at risk or homeless young people between the ages of 15 and 25.

### Our Core Values
INTENTIONS – we aspire to be perfectly intended in the way we work with young people, each other and those others in the community we come into contact with.
UNIQUENESS – we believe every young person has the capacity to grow, make their own choices and to contribute meaningfully if given an environment that supports building a personality beyond its normal limitations.
LEADERSHIP and SERVICE – we submit to the leadership of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of love, mercy, compassion, forgiveness and hope in our approach to working effectively with young people at risk.
ACCEPTANCE – is about offering all those we work for and with ‘fair and decent’ treatment by acting out of tolerance, recognising and acknowledging differences and developing understanding that each person is an equal individual worthy of respect and to be treated with due dignity.
TEAMWORK – we believe that teamwork is about discovering, valuing and nurturing how people “work best with other people”. By best we mean how people produce valuable results, feel good about themselves, the organisation and other people they work with.
PRAYER – Prayer is powerful and that through faith in God prayer can change circumstances.

### THE LOGO
The Calvary logo was created by an indigenous client who was residing in the crisis centre at the time. The logo symbolises the journey a young person may experience when they encounter our accommodation program.
The sun offers warmth and hope as the pathway tells of the good times and challenges facing young people seeking to break free from their crisis issue.
The logo also includes the wave which is a feature of the Peel region and also symbolises the often difficult challenges of riding the wave safely to shore.
The pathway ultimately leads towards the sun and a horizon of hope, possibility and success
